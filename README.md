# PDF Merger Tool

A simple desktop GUI application to **merge multiple PDF files** with drag-and-drop ordering and a clean interface.

I built this tool because I often need to combine multiple PDFs and wanted something lightweight and offline â€” without having to upload files to online tools every time.

## ðŸ’» How to Run

Clone or download this repository, then from the project folder run:

```bash

2. Reorder them as needed by dragging
3. Click **Merge PDFs** and choose a file name to save

##  Build a Standalone `.exe`

If you want to use it without opening a terminal each time, you can package it as a single executable using **PyInstaller**:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico pdf_merger.py
```

* `--onefile` â†’ bundles everything into one file
* `--windowed` â†’ hides the terminal window
* `--icon=icon.ico` â†’ adds a custom icon (optional)

The generated `.exe` will appear in the `dist/` folder.
```
